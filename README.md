# My miscellaneous, dirty experiments of programming :man_technologist:

This is where I make experiments to improve my code. Here, I can test workflows,
code, and some GitHub features. You may like to read the different `README`s accross this
repository, where I explain what am I doing on each experiment, and maybe a good reason
to try it out!
