# JavaScript experiments :computer: :earth_americas:

```javascript
var text = "Hello, I will try JavaScript.";

tool_from_html.print(text); // function provided by another script used by an HTML
```

With `Node.js` _(or another similar tool)_, it is powerful on my desktop. Inside an HTML, I can create great websites. One way or another, JavaScript is a good
language. **I'll give it a chance**, and maybe I'll like it, I don't know!
