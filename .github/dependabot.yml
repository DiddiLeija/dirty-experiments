# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://help.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates

updates:
  # First, look for GitHb actions updates
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions" # Take the github actions dependencies
    directory: "/" # Find the manifests
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
      time: "09:00" # update at 9:00 AM 
      timezone: "America/Mexico_City" # use my current timezone
  # Now look for the pip dependencies
  # (example: setup.py files)
  - package-ecosystem: "pip" # Take the pip dependencies
    directory: "/" # Find the manifests
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
      time: "09:00" # update at 9:00 AM 
      timezone: "America/Mexico_City" # use my current timezone
