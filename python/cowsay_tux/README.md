                                                   \
                                                    \
                                                     \
                                                      .--.
                                                     |o_o |
                                                     |:_/ |
                                                    //   \ \
                                                   (|     | )
                                                  /'\_   _/`\
                                                  \___)=(___/
```

I really like how the message looks like (it's cute!). Doing this is just a hobby for me, but I want to share it.
