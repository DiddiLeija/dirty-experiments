# Python experiments :snake:

```python
print("I like to run Python code!")
```

Probably, Python is my favorite programming language: it is simple, but also powerful. On this section,
I will be trying many packages, code tricks, modules, and other interesting features from Python.

_Side note:_ I'm talking about Python 3 (specificly, 3.6 or newer). The life of the Python 2 has ended.
