# Experiments with C++ :desktop_computer:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

print("I want to be a C++ expert!");
```

I like C++, because I can use it on many, many projects.

For example: I use [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) for programming hardware, and [its syntax is based on C++](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/). Also, I can use it
to build desktop applications (that's what I want).
At this moment, **I'm learning to improve my C++ programming**. As I learn new things, I'll upload some cool experiments, you'll see.
