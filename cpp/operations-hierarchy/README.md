# Demonstration of the operations hierarchy, respected by C++

This is a dumb test of the \[math\] operations hierarchy used in
C++. This program takes two floats (`a` and `b`), and makes an `a/b+1`
operation. If the hierarchy is respected, a certain value will be
printed. Also, if the result is a long floating value, it will be truncated
via `cout.precision(3)`.

## Sample

```
Introduce the value of 'a': 10
Introduce the value of 'b': 2

Result: 6
```

`a / b + 1` = 6.
