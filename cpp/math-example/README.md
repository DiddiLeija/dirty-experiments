# Math operations with C++

C++ has a `math.h` header, to provide multiple math functions. On this section, I would like to experiment with those operations. I will take
4 floating numbers from the user (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) to resolve this:

```
(a + pow(b * a), 3) - (sqrt((c / d)))
```

and then we return the results to the user.
