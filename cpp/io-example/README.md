# Simple I/O example with C++

This example shows a simple `main` function, which
takes a numeric value, and then print it. The code will try to use the
namespace `std` for the IO, so you should check that first. Also I am taking
a standard lib `iostream` (also check that!).

_(I tried this with a C++ editor, so tell me if this fails on another cases!)_.
